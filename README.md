Stock market Prediction using Arima And LSTM

# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

## Overview
This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices for Apple Inc. (AAPL). It fetches historical stock price data using the Yahoo Finance API and preprocesses the data for model training and testing. The LSTM model is trained on a time series of stock prices and used to make future price predictions.

## Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow
- matplotlib
- pandas_datareader
- yfinance

## Usage
1. Run the provided Python script to fetch historical stock price data, preprocess the data, build the LSTM model, and make predictions.
2. Modify the script as needed for custom analysis or parameter tuning.

## Steps
1. **Data Retrieval**: Fetch historical stock price data for AAPL from Yahoo Finance using the `pandas_datareader` and `yfinance` libraries.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Standardize the data using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn and create input-output pairs for the LSTM model using the `create_dataset` function.
3. **Model Building**: Construct an LSTM model with multiple layers using TensorFlow's Keras API. Compile the model with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.
4. **Model Training**: Train the LSTM model on the training data for a specified number of epochs and batch size.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using root mean squared error (RMSE) on both training and testing datasets.
6. **Visualization**: Visualize the actual stock prices, training predictions, and test predictions using Matplotlib.

## Results
- The LSTM model achieves a certain level of accuracy in predicting future stock prices based on historical data.
- The performance metrics such as RMSE can be used to assess the quality of predictions.

## Future Work
- Experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and input features to improve prediction accuracy.
- Explore additional techniques such as attention mechanisms or hybrid models for better capturing temporal dependencies.
